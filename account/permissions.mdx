## Available Permissions

### Can View Billable Minutes

<Warning>

</Warning>

## Agent-Level Access

In addition to feature permissions, you control which agents each member can access:

| Access Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Full Access** | Member can view calls and edit the agent (if permissions allow) |
| **No Access** | Agent is hidden from the member entirely |

### How Agent Access Works

1. Members only see agents they're assigned to
2. Call history is filtered to show only calls from assigned agents
3. CRM data is accessible across all assigned agents
4. Reporting shows data from assigned agents only

## Syncing Permissions

If a member's permissions seem incorrect, administrators can sync their Firebase claims:

1. Find the member in the list
2. Click the **Sync Claims** button (only visible for advanced editor users)
3. Confirm the sync

This updates the member's authentication tokens with the latest permissions from the database.
