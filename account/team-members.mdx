## Best Practices

1. **Principle of least privilege**: Only grant permissions that members actually need
2. **Agent-specific access**: Assign members only to agents they work with
3. **Regular audits**: Periodically review member access and remove inactive users
4. **Secure passwords**: Use strong passwords when creating accounts without email invitations
