The Reporting System provides comprehensive analytics for your conversational AI agents with advanced filtering, metrics tracking, and data export capabilities.

## Overview

The reporting system offers detailed insights into agent performance, call metrics, and conversion analytics with temporal analysis to help you optimize your AI agents.

<Info>
All reports are generated in real-time and can be exported to CSV format for further analysis.
</Info>

## Getting Started

<Steps>
<Step title="Access Reports">
Navigate to the Reports section in your dashboard to begin generating analytics reports.
</Step>
<Step title="Select Agents">
Choose which agents you want to include in your report from the available list.
</Step>
<Step title="Configure Filters">
Set date ranges, status filters, and other criteria to focus your analysis.
</Step>
<Step title="Generate Report">
Click "Generate Report" to create your comprehensive analytics report.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Report Filters

### Basic Filters

Configure your report scope with these fundamental filters:

- **Agent Selection**: Choose specific agents or select all agents
- **Date Range**: Set start and end dates for your analysis period
- **Status Filter**: Filter by call status (completed, missed, failed, etc.)
- **Call Type**: Filter by inbound, outbound, or transferred calls

### Advanced Filters

Refine your analysis with additional criteria:

```typescript
interface ReportFilters {
  agent_ids: string[];
  start_date: string;
  end_date: string;
  filters?: {
    status?: string[];
    call_type?: string[];
    min_duration?: number;
    max_duration?: number;
    min_nps_score?: number;
    max_nps_score?: number;
  };
}
```

**Duration Filters**:
- Set minimum and maximum call duration thresholds
- Analyze calls within specific time ranges

**NPS Score Filters**:
- Filter by Net Promoter Score ranges
- Focus on high or low satisfaction calls

## Agent Metrics

Each report provides comprehensive metrics for selected agents:

### Core Metrics

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Call Statistics">
- **Total Calls**: All initiated calls
- **Completed Calls**: Successfully finished conversations
- **Converted Calls**: Calls that achieved objectives
- **Received Calls**: Inbound calls handled
- **Outbound Calls**: Agent-initiated calls
- **Transferred Calls**: Calls passed to human agents
</Tab>
<Tab title="Performance Metrics">
- **Completion Rate**: Percentage of calls completed successfully
- **Conversion Rate**: Percentage of calls that converted
- **Contact Rate**: Percentage of leads successfully contacted
- **Transfer Rate**: Percentage of calls transferred to humans
</Tab>
<Tab title="Duration Analysis">
- **Average Duration**: Mean call length
- **Total Conversation Time**: Sum of all call durations
- **Duration Standard Deviation**: Variability in call lengths
- **Billable Minutes**: Total charged conversation time
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Customer Satisfaction

<Info>
NPS (Net Promoter Score) tracking is available for agents with NPS activation enabled.
</Info>

- **Average NPS Score**: Mean customer satisfaction rating
- **NPS Surveys Count**: Number of completed satisfaction surveys
- **NPS Response Rate**: Percentage of customers who responded to surveys

### Lead Management

Track your lead conversion funnel:

- **Unique Leads**: Total number of distinct leads
- **Contacted Leads**: Leads successfully reached
- **Converted Leads**: Leads that completed desired actions
- **Conversion from Contacted Rate**: Efficiency of contacted lead conversion

## Temporal Analysis

### Daily Breakdown

View performance trends over time with daily metrics:

```typescript
daily_data: Array<{
  date: string;
  calls: number;
  unique_leads: number;
  contacted_leads: number;
  converted_leads: number;
  completed_calls: number;
  conversions: number;
  avg_duration: number;
  conversion_rate: number;
  // Additional metrics...
}>
```

**Key Daily Metrics**:
- Call volume trends
- Conversion rate fluctuations
- Duration patterns
- Lead engagement levels

### Hourly Analysis

Optimize scheduling with hourly performance data:

- **Peak Hours**: Identify most effective calling times
- **Conversion by Hour**: Success rates throughout the day
- **Duration Patterns**: Average call lengths by time of day

<Warning>
Hourly analysis requires sufficient data volume for meaningful insights. Reports with fewer than 50 calls may show limited hourly patterns.
</Warning>

## Data Export

### CSV Export

Export your reports for external analysis:

<Steps>
<Step title="Generate Report">
Create your report with desired filters and date range.
</Step>
<Step title="Export Options">
Choose CSV format and optionally specify a custom filename.
</Step>
<Step title="Download">
The system will generate and download your CSV file with all report data.
</Step>
</Steps>

**CSV Export Includes**:
- Agent metrics summary
- Daily temporal data
- Hourly analysis
- Status distribution
- Call details (if included in filters)

### Export Format

```typescript
// Export request structure
{
  report_data: ReportData,
  format: 'csv',
  filename?: string // Optional custom filename
}
```

## Report Templates

### Predefined Templates

Use pre-configured templates for common reporting needs:

- **Daily Performance**: Standard daily metrics overview
- **Weekly Summary**: 7-day performance analysis
- **Monthly Review**: Comprehensive monthly report
- **Conversion Analysis**: Focus on conversion metrics
- **NPS Analysis**: Customer satisfaction report

### Custom Templates

Create and save your own report configurations:

```typescript
interface ReportTemplate {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  filters: ReportFilters;
}
```

## Status Distribution

Understand call outcomes with status distribution analysis:

- **Completion Status**: Breakdown of finished, ongoing, and failed calls
- **Contact Results**: Distribution of answered, missed, and unreachable calls
- **Percentage Analysis**: Visual representation of status proportions

Common statuses include:
- `closed`: Successfully finished calls
- `open`: Currently ongoing calls
- `no-answer`: Unanswered calls
- `voicemail`: Calls reaching voicemail
- `failed`: Technical failures
- `busy`: Busy line encounters

## Best Practices

### Effective Reporting

<Info>
For optimal insights, use date ranges that provide sufficient data while remaining focused on your analysis goals.
</Info>

1. **Regular Monitoring**: Generate weekly reports to track performance trends
2. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare different time periods to identify improvements
3. **Agent Benchmarking**: Compare agent performance to identify best practices
4. **Seasonal Adjustments**: Account for seasonal variations in your analysis

### Data Interpretation

- **Look for Patterns**: Identify recurring trends in daily and hourly data
- **Context Matters**: Consider external factors affecting call performance
- **Actionable Insights**: Focus on metrics you can improve through optimization

### Performance Optimization

Use reporting data to:
- Adjust calling schedules based on hourly success rates
- Optimize agent scripts based on conversion analysis
- Improve lead quality based on contact rate insights
- Enhance customer experience using NPS feedback

## API Integration

The Reporting Service provides programmatic access to all reporting functionality:

```typescript
// Generate a report
const reportData = await reportingService.generateReport(filters);

// Export report data
const csvBlob = await reportingService.exportReport(reportData, 'csv');

// Get available agents
const agents = await reportingService.getAgents();

// Access report templates
const templates = await reportingService.getTemplates();
```

<Warning>
API access requires proper authentication tokens. Ensure your integration handles token refresh for long-running processes.
