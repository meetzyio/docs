## Key Metrics Overview

Once you've selected an agent and loaded the evaluation data, you'll see three main summary cards:

### Total Evaluations
The total number of evaluations conducted for the selected agent within your chosen time range. This gives you a quick overview of evaluation activity volume.

### Overall Success Rate
The average success rate across all evaluations, displayed as a percentage. This metric helps you understand the general performance level of your agent.

### Calls Evaluated  
The number of individual calls that have been evaluated, providing context for the total evaluation count.

<Info>
These summary metrics update automatically when you change your time range or grouping period, giving you real-time insights into different aspects of your agent's performance.
