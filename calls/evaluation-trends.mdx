- **Last 6 months** - Monthly grouping
- **Custom range** - Choose your own dates

### Data Grouping

Control how your data is aggregated:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Day">
    Perfect for short-term analysis and daily performance tracking
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Week">
    Ideal for identifying weekly patterns and trends
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Month">
    Best for long-term analysis and monthly reporting
  </Tab>

## Understanding the Metrics Dashboard

### Summary Cards

At the top of the dashboard, you'll find three key performance indicators:

1. **Total Evaluations** - The total number of evaluations performed in the selected period
2. **Global Success Rate** - The overall success percentage across all evaluations
3. **Total Calls Evaluated** - The number of individual calls that were evaluated

### Interactive Performance Charts

Each evaluation criterion has its own interactive chart showing:

- **Success rate trends** over time
- **Interactive zoom and pan** capabilities
- **Hover tooltips** with detailed data points
- **Color-coded performance levels**:
  - 🟢 Green (80%+): Excellent performance
  - 🟡 Amber (60-79%): Good performance with room for improvement
  - 🔴 Red (<60%): Needs attention

<Warning>
Charts may show gaps in data if there were no evaluations performed during certain periods. This is normal and expected behavior.
</Warning>

## Chart Navigation and Interaction

### Zoom and Pan Features

- **Mouse wheel**: Zoom in and out on the timeline
- **Click and drag**: Pan across different time periods
- **Double-click**: Reset zoom to show the full dataset
- **Hover**: View exact values and dates

### Chart Controls

Each chart includes:
- **Reset zoom button** to return to the full view
- **Legend** showing evaluation names and colors
- **Responsive design** that adapts to your screen size

## Detailed Data Tables

Below the charts, you'll find comprehensive data tables with:

### Performance Sparklines

Miniature trend charts (sparklines) that show the performance trajectory for each evaluation at a glance.

### Key Metrics Columns

- **Total Evaluations**: Number of evaluations performed
- **Successful Evaluations**: Number of successful evaluations
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful evaluations
- **Calls Evaluated**: Total calls evaluated for each criterion

### Trend Indicators

Visual indicators showing whether performance is:
- ⬆️ **Trending up** (improving)
- ⬇️ **Trending down** (declining) 
- ➡️ **Stable** (consistent)

## Optimizing Agent Performance

### Identifying Patterns

Use the trends data to:

1. **Spot recurring issues** - Look for consistent low-performance periods
2. **Identify improvement opportunities** - Find evaluations with declining trends
3. **Recognize successful strategies** - Note what works well during high-performance periods
4. **Plan training sessions** - Use data to target specific areas needing attention

### Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Regular Monitoring">
    Check trends weekly to stay on top of performance changes
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Comparative Analysis">
    Compare different time periods to understand seasonal or cyclical patterns
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Data-Driven Decisions">
    Use the metrics to make informed adjustments to your agent configurations
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Goal Setting">
    Set realistic improvement targets based on historical performance data
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tips for Effective Analysis

### Choosing the Right Time Frame

- **Short-term analysis (7-14 days)**: Great for immediate performance assessment and quick fixes
- **Medium-term analysis (30 days-3 months)**: Ideal for identifying trends and planning improvements
- **Long-term analysis (6+ months)**: Perfect for strategic planning and annual reviews

### Reading the Data

- **Focus on trends rather than individual data points** - Temporary dips are normal
- **Look for consistent patterns** - Sustained improvements or declines are more significant
- **Consider external factors** - Changes in agent configuration, training, or business conditions

### Taking Action

When you identify areas for improvement:

1. **Document findings** - Keep notes on what the data reveals
2. **Plan interventions** - Develop specific actions to address issues
3. **Monitor results** - Track whether changes lead to improvements
4. **Iterate and improve** - Continuously refine your approach based on data
