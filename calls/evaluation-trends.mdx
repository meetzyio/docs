The Evaluation Trends feature provides powerful insights into how your agents' performance evolves over time. Monitor evaluation success rates, identify improvement patterns, and make data-driven decisions to optimize your conversational AI.

## Overview

Access evaluation trends through the main navigation or by selecting an agent from your dashboard. This comprehensive analytics tool helps you:

- Track evaluation performance across different time periods
- Compare success rates between multiple evaluation criteria
- Identify trends and patterns in agent behavior
- Monitor improvements after training or configuration changes

<Info>
Evaluation trends are calculated based on your configured evaluation criteria and require completed calls with evaluation data to display meaningful insights.

## Summary Metrics

The dashboard displays three key performance indicators at the top:

### Total Evaluations
The complete number of evaluation instances run across all your criteria during the selected time period.

### Overall Success Rate
A weighted average of all successful evaluations compared to total evaluations, giving you a quick health check of your agent's performance.

### Calls Evaluated
The total number of individual calls that have been evaluated, helping you understand your evaluation coverage.

<Warning>
Success rates are calculated only from calls that have completed evaluations. Calls without evaluation data are not included in these metrics.
</Warning>

## Time Range Controls

### Pre-defined Ranges
Choose from common analysis periods:
- **Last 7 days**: Ideal for daily monitoring and recent changes
- **Last 14 days**: Good for weekly pattern analysis
- **Last 30 days**: Standard monthly performance review
- **Last 3 months**: Quarterly trend analysis
- **Last 6 months**: Long-term performance tracking

### Custom Date Range
Select specific start and end dates for targeted analysis periods, such as:
- Before and after training sessions
- Specific campaign periods
- Seasonal performance comparisons

## Data Grouping Options

### Daily Grouping
Shows evaluation trends on a day-by-day basis. Best for:
- Short-term analysis (up to 30 days)
- Identifying daily patterns
- Monitoring immediate impact of changes

### Weekly Grouping
Aggregates data by week to smooth out daily variations. Ideal for:
- Medium-term trend analysis
- Reducing noise in daily fluctuations
- Monthly and quarterly reviews

### Monthly Grouping
Groups data by month for long-term trend analysis. Perfect for:
- Quarterly and yearly reviews
- Long-term performance tracking
- Strategic planning and goal setting

## Interactive Charts

### Chart Features
Each evaluation criterion displays as a separate line on the interactive chart:

- **Zoom and Pan**: Click and drag to zoom into specific time periods, use mouse wheel for quick zoom adjustments
- **Hover Details**: Mouse over data points to see exact values, dates, and success percentages
- **Legend Interaction**: Click legend items to show/hide specific evaluation criteria
- **Reset View**: Double-click the chart to return to the full view

### Color Coding
Charts use distinct colors for each evaluation criterion, making it easy to:
- Track individual metrics over time
- Compare performance between different criteria
- Identify correlations and patterns

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Success Rate Colors">
- **Green (80%+)**: Excellent performance
- **Yellow (60-79%)**: Good performance with room for improvement  
- **Red (Below 60%)**: Needs attention and optimization
</Tab>

<Tab title="Chart Interactions">
- **Single Click**: Select data point for details
- **Click + Drag**: Zoom into time range
- **Double Click**: Reset to full view
- **Scroll Wheel**: Quick zoom in/out
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Detailed Data Tables

### Expandable Sections
Click on any agent name to expand detailed evaluation breakdowns:

- **Evaluation Criteria**: Individual success rates for each configured evaluation
- **Sparkline Charts**: Mini trend indicators showing recent performance direction
- **Trend Indicators**: Visual arrows showing whether performance is improving, declining, or stable

### Data Interpretation
Each row in the expanded table shows:
- **Evaluation Name**: The specific criterion being measured
- **Latest Rate**: Most recent success rate percentage
- **Trend Direction**: Up/down/flat arrow based on recent performance changes
- **Mini Chart**: Sparkline showing the recent trend pattern

<Info>
Trend directions are calculated by comparing the most recent data point with the previous period. Changes of less than 2% are considered "flat" to account for normal variation.

## Best Practices

### Regular Monitoring
- Check trends weekly to catch issues early
- Set up consistent review schedules
- Compare periods before and after changes

### Data Analysis
- Look for patterns across multiple evaluation criteria
- Consider external factors that might affect performance
- Use longer time ranges to identify genuine trends vs. random fluctuations

### Performance Optimization
- Identify consistently underperforming evaluations
- Correlate trends with training or configuration changes
- Use insights to guide agent improvement strategies

## Troubleshooting

### No Data Available
If charts appear empty:
- Ensure calls have been made during the selected time period
- Verify evaluation criteria are properly configured
- Check that evaluations have completed processing

### Inconsistent Trends
If data appears erratic:
- Increase the time range for more stable trends
- Switch to weekly or monthly grouping to smooth variations
- Consider if external factors are affecting call patterns

<Warning>
Evaluation data is processed asynchronously. Recent calls may take a few minutes to appear in trends after completion.
