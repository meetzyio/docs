## Interactive Performance Charts

### Chart Features and Capabilities

Each evaluation criterion displays in its own interactive chart with advanced features:

#### Visual Performance Indicators

Charts use color-coding to instantly communicate performance levels:

- 🟢 **Green (80%+)**: Excellent performance - consistently meeting or exceeding expectations
- 🟡 **Amber (60-79%)**: Good performance with improvement opportunities
- 🔴 **Red (<60%)**: Requires attention - performance below acceptable thresholds

#### Interactive Navigation

- **Mouse wheel zoom**: Scroll to zoom in and out on specific time periods
- **Click and drag panning**: Move across different sections of your timeline
- **Hover tooltips**: View exact values, dates, and additional context
- **Double-click reset**: Instantly return to the full dataset view
- **Responsive design**: Charts automatically adapt to your screen size and orientation

#### Sparkline Integration

Miniature trend indicators (sparklines) provide at-a-glance performance trajectories:

- **Trending up** ⬆️: Performance is improving over time
- **Trending down** ⬇️: Performance is declining and may need attention
- **Stable** ➡️: Performance remains consistent across the time period

### Chart Data Interpretation

#### Understanding Gaps and Patterns

- **Data gaps**: Empty spaces in charts indicate periods with no evaluations - this is normal behavior
- **Trend lines**: Follow the general direction of performance over time
- **Peak identification**: Spot periods of exceptional performance for replication
- **Valley analysis**: Identify low-performance periods for investigation

<Info>
Charts automatically scale to show the full range of your data, but you can zoom in on specific periods for detailed analysis of shorter timeframes.
