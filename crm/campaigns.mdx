- ✅ Keeping consent records

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Low answer rate | Adjust calling hours, check caller ID reputation |
| High failure rate | Verify phone numbers, check agent phone health |
| Slow progress | Increase concurrent calls or calls per hour |
| Campaign won't start | Ensure agent has active phone number |
