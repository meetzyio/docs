openapi: 'POST /call'

## Overview

This endpoint initiates an outbound call using a pre-trained playbook. The call will be made using your configured phone number and the AI will follow the playbook's instructions.

## Version Control

By default, this endpoint uses the **production version** of your playbook. This ensures that all API calls use the same configuration you've designated as production-ready in the dashboard.

<Tip>
  You can optionally specify a `version_id` parameter to use a specific version of your playbook. This is useful for testing new versions before marking them as production. See [Agent Versioning](/api-reference/endpoint/versioning) for more details.
</Tip>

### Default Behavior

When you call this endpoint without a `version_id`:
1. The system looks for the playbook's **production version**
2. If found, it uses that version's configuration (prompt, voice, settings, etc.)
3. If no versions exist, it falls back to the current playbook configuration

### Using a Specific Version

```json
{
  "phone": "+34600000000",
  "playbook_id": "your-playbook-id",
  "version_id": "optional-version-uuid"
}
```

## Response

A successful response includes the call ID which you can use to track the call status:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "id": "call-uuid",
  "message": "Call processing started"
}
```
