</Tip>

### Call Recording

Toggle to enable/disable call recordings. When enabled:
- All calls are recorded and stored
- Recordings are available in the Calls section
- Required for quality assurance and training

### Meetzy Foundation

Optional base components that enhance your agent:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Safety Guardrails** | Prevents harmful or inappropriate responses |
| **Conversational Aspects** | Improves natural conversation flow |
| **Agent Work Experience** | Pre-trained behaviors for common scenarios |

## Step 2: Greetings

Click the **Greetings** icon (Hand Raised) to configure welcome messages.

### Inbound Greeting

The first message when a customer calls your agent:

```
Hello! Thank you for calling {{company_name}}. How can I help you today?
```

### Outbound Greeting

The first message when your agent calls a customer:

```
Hi {{customer_name}}, this is {{agent_name}} from {{company_name}}. 
I'm calling regarding {{reason}}. Is this a good time to talk?
```

### Templates

Select from pre-built greeting templates:
- Sales Call
- Customer Support
- Appointment Reminder
- Survey Introduction

### Dynamic Variables

Use variables to personalize greetings:

| Variable | Example |
|----------|---------|
| `{{customer_name}}` | "John" |
| `{{company_name}}` | "Acme Corp" |
| `{{agent_name}}` | "Sarah" |
| `{{appointment_date}}` | "March 15th at 2pm" |

## Step 3: System Prompt

The central editor contains the **System Prompt** - the core instructions that define your agent's behavior.

### Structure

A good system prompt includes:

1. **Role Definition**: Who the agent is
2. **Objective**: What the agent should accomplish
3. **Guidelines**: How to handle specific situations
4. **Constraints**: What the agent should NOT do

### Example

```markdown
You are a friendly sales qualification agent for Acme Corp.

## Objective
Qualify leads by understanding their needs and budget, 
then schedule a demo with a sales representative.

## Guidelines
- Be conversational and friendly
- Ask about their current challenges
- Understand their timeline and budget
- If qualified, offer to schedule a demo

## Constraints
- Never discuss pricing directly
- Don't make promises about features
- Transfer to human if customer is upset
```

## Step 4: Input Params

Click the **Input Params** icon (Document) to define variables passed to each call.

Common parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `phone` | String | Customer's phone number |
| `name` | String | Customer's name |
| `email` | String | Customer's email |
| `company` | String | Customer's company |
| `lead_source` | String | Where the lead came from |

These parameters are available in your system prompt and greetings using `{{param_name}}` syntax.

## Step 5: Knowledge Base

Click the **Knowledge Base** icon (Book Stack) to add reference documents.

Upload documents the agent can reference during calls:
- Product FAQs
- Pricing information
- Company policies
- Common objections and responses

<Note>
  The agent searches the knowledge base contextually during conversations. It doesn't memorize everything - it retrieves relevant information when needed.
</Note>

## Step 6: Actions & Tools

Click the **Actions & Tools** icon (Wrench) to configure integrations.

Available actions:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Transfer Call** | Route to human agent |
| **Send SMS** | Send text message to customer |
| **Send Email** | Send email to customer |
| **Calendar Booking** | Schedule appointments |
| **CRM Update** | Update customer records |
| **Custom Webhook** | Call any external API |

## Step 7: Evaluations

Click the **Evaluations** icon (Check Badge) to set up automated tests.

Create test scenarios to validate your agent:

```
Scenario: Customer asks about pricing
Expected: Agent should NOT discuss specific prices
Expected: Agent should offer to connect with sales team
```

## Step 8: Output Settings

Click the **Output Settings** icon (Inbox) to define data extraction.

Specify what information the agent should capture:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `qualified` | Boolean | Is the lead qualified? |
| `budget_range` | String | Estimated budget |
| `timeline` | String | Purchase timeline |
| `next_steps` | String | Agreed follow-up actions |
| `pain_points` | Array | Customer's challenges |

Extracted data is available in call summaries and can be sent to your CRM.
