## Overview

The Actions & Tools section allows you to configure what your agent can do during and after calls. This includes transferring calls, ending conversations, making API requests, and setting up automated follow-up protocols.

## Call Transfer

Configure how your agent handles call transfers to human agents or other departments.

### Transfer Configuration

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Transfer Number | Phone number to transfer calls to |
| Transfer Prompt | Instructions for when to transfer |
| Warm Transfer | Brief the receiving agent before transfer |

<Tip>
Use warm transfers when the receiving agent needs context about the conversation before taking over.
</Tip>

### Transfer Best Practices

1. **Set Clear Triggers** - Define specific scenarios that warrant a transfer
2. **Provide Context** - Configure what information to pass to the receiving agent
3. **Have Fallbacks** - Set backup numbers if the primary line is busy

## End Call

Configure how your agent concludes conversations.

### End Call Settings

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| End Call Prompt | Conditions that trigger call ending |
| Goodbye Message | Final message before hanging up |
| Language Templates | Pre-configured messages in different languages |

### Language Templates

The system provides pre-built templates for common scenarios in multiple languages:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="English">
    - Professional goodbye
    - Casual farewell
    - Service completion message
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Spanish">
    - Despedida profesional
    - Despedida casual
    - Mensaje de servicio completado
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="French">
    - Au revoir professionnel
    - Adieu décontracté
    - Message de service terminé
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Webhook Tools

Create custom integrations by defining webhook tools that your agent can trigger during conversations.

### Creating a Webhook Tool

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add New Tool">
    Click "Add Webhook Tool" to create a new integration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Basic Info">
    Set the tool name and description (this helps the AI understand when to use it).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Endpoint">
    Enter the webhook URL that will receive the request.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Method">
    Select HTTP method: GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Parameters">
    Add query parameters or body fields the agent should send.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Webhook Configuration

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Name | Identifier for the tool |
| Description | When and why to use this tool |
| URL | Endpoint to call |
| Method | HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) |
| Query Params | URL parameters |
| Body Params | Request body fields |

### Parameter Types

Each parameter can be configured with:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Name | Parameter identifier |
| Type | string, number, boolean |
| Description | What the parameter represents |
| Required | Whether the agent must provide it |

### Advanced Settings

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Interruption Control" icon="pause">
    Configure whether the agent pauses while waiting for the webhook response.
    
    - **Wait for response** - Agent pauses until API responds
    - **Continue speaking** - Agent continues while request processes
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Execution Mode" icon="play">
    Control when the webhook executes:
    
    - **Immediate** - Execute as soon as triggered
    - **Deferred** - Queue for execution after the call
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Example Webhook: CRM Integration

```json
{
  "name": "create_lead",
  "description": "Create a new lead in the CRM when customer shows interest",
  "url": "https://api.yourcrm.com/leads",
  "method": "POST",
  "body": {
    "name": "Customer's full name",
    "phone": "Customer's phone number",
    "interest": "What product they're interested in"
  }
}
```

## Recall Protocol

Set up automatic follow-up calls when certain conditions aren't met.

### Recall Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Enable Recall | Turn on/off automatic callbacks |
| Max Attempts | Maximum number of retry calls |
| Schedule | Time between retry attempts |
| Conditions | When to trigger a recall |

<Warning>
Use recall protocols responsibly. Too many callbacks can annoy customers and may violate regulations.
</Warning>

### Recall Schedule Options

- 5 minutes
- 15 minutes
- 30 minutes
- 1 hour
- 2 hours
- 4 hours
- Next business day

## Coming Soon

The following integrations are in development:

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| 📧 Send Email | Send emails during or after calls | Coming Soon |
| 💬 Send SMS | Send text messages to customers | Coming Soon |
| 📱 Send WhatsApp | Send WhatsApp messages | Coming Soon |

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Descriptions** - Write detailed tool descriptions so the AI knows exactly when to use them
2. **Handle Errors** - Your webhook should return appropriate error messages the agent can relay
3. **Test Thoroughly** - Use the Playground to verify webhook integrations work correctly
4. **Monitor Usage** - Track webhook calls to ensure they're firing as expected
5. **Secure Endpoints** - Use authentication headers for sensitive APIs
