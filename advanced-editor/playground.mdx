## What is the Playground?

The Playground is a testing environment in the Advanced Editor where you can interact with your agent in real-time. It allows you to simulate conversations, test different scenarios, and validate your agent's behavior before deploying to production.

<Info>
Testing in the Playground saves time and money by catching issues before they affect real customer calls.
</Info>

## Accessing the Playground

The Playground is located in the right panel of the Advanced Editor. Click the "Playground" tab to access it.

## Call Types

You can simulate two types of calls:

| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| 📞 Inbound | Customer calling your agent | Test welcome flow, support scenarios |
| 📤 Outbound | Agent calling a customer | Test introductions, sales scripts |

<Tip>
Switch between call types to test both greetings and ensure your agent handles each scenario correctly.
</Tip>

## Sending Messages

### Text Input

Type messages in the input field and press Enter or click Send. The agent will respond as it would in a real call.

### Voice Input

Click the microphone icon to speak your message. The agent will:
1. Transcribe your speech
2. Process the message
3. Respond with synthesized voice

<Info>
Voice testing helps verify speech recognition accuracy and voice synthesis quality.
</Info>

## Conversation View

The Playground displays messages chronologically:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 👤 User Message | Your inputs (text or transcribed voice) |
| 🤖 Agent Message | Agent responses |
| 🔧 Tool Call | When agent triggers a webhook or action |
| ✅ Tool Result | Response from webhook or action |

### Audio Playback

For each agent response, you can:
- ▶️ Play the audio response
- ⏸️ Pause playback
- 🔁 Replay messages

## Context Variables

Test how your agent handles different input parameters:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Context Variables">
    Click the "Context Variables" panel in the Playground.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Values">
    Enter test values for each input parameter.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Conversation">
    Begin testing with the configured context.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example Context

```json
{
  "customer_name": "John Smith",
  "order_number": "ORD-12345",
  "is_premium_customer": true,
  "account_balance": 1250.50
}
```

## Reliability Test

Run multiple iterations of the same conversation to test consistency:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Scenario">
    Set up your test conversation and context variables.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Iterations">
    Choose how many times to run the test (e.g., 10, 50, 100).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run Test">
    Click "Run Reliability Test" to start.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Results">
    Analyze consistency across all iterations.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Reliability tests help identify edge cases where the agent might behave inconsistently.
</Info>

## Testing Features

### Test Tool Calls

When your agent triggers a webhook:

1. The tool call appears in the conversation
2. You can see the parameters being sent
3. The response (or mock response) is displayed

### Test Evaluations

After a conversation, you can run evaluations to verify they work correctly:

1. End the conversation naturally
2. Click "Run Evaluations"
3. Review which evaluations pass or fail

### Test Knowledge Base

Verify your agent can find and use knowledge base content:

1. Ask questions that require KB lookup
2. Observe if the agent retrieves correct information
3. Check if responses are accurate and relevant

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Test Edge Cases" icon="flask">
    Try unusual inputs, interruptions, and unexpected responses to see how your agent handles them.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Vary Context" icon="shuffle">
    Test with different input parameter combinations to ensure personalization works correctly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Test Both Call Types" icon="phone">
    Always test both inbound and outbound scenarios.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Check Tool Integrations" icon="plug">
    Verify webhooks are called with correct parameters.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Run Reliability Tests" icon="rotate">
    Periodically run multi-iteration tests to ensure consistency.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Testing Scenarios

### Happy Path
Test the ideal conversation flow where everything goes as expected.

### Error Handling
Test what happens when:
- User provides invalid information
- Webhooks fail
- User doesn't respond

### Objection Handling
Test how the agent responds to:
- "I'm not interested"
- "Call me back later"
- "I need to think about it"

### Edge Cases
Test unusual scenarios:
- Very short responses
- Long, rambling inputs
- Off-topic questions
- Multiple questions at once

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Agent not responding | Check if LLM model is configured correctly |
| Wrong greeting | Verify call type (inbound/outbound) is set correctly |
| Missing personalization | Ensure context variables are set |
| Webhook not triggering | Check tool descriptions and conditions |
| Slow responses | Try a faster LLM model |
