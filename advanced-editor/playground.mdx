## What is the Playground?

The Playground is an enhanced testing environment in the Advanced Editor where you can interact with your agent in real-time. It allows you to simulate conversations, test different scenarios, and validate your agent's behavior before deploying to production, all while leveraging the improved code editor features.

<Info>
Testing in the Playground saves time and money by catching issues before they affect real customer calls, with enhanced debugging capabilities through the improved editor interface.
</Info>

## Enhanced Editor Integration

The Playground now benefits from the Advanced Editor's improved interface, including:

- **View Controls**: Use outline, indented view, and minimap for better code navigation
- **Diff Mode**: Compare changes with inline/split view options when working with versions
- **Focus Mode**: Minimize distractions while testing
- **Version Integration**: See how changes from different versions affect playground behavior

## Accessing the Playground

The Playground is located in the right panel of the Advanced Editor. Click the "Playground" tab to access it.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Advanced Editor">
    Open your agent in the Advanced Editor.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Playground">
    Click the "Playground" tab in the right panel.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure View">
    Use the editor view controls (outline, minimap, focus mode) to optimize your workspace.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Call Types

You can simulate two types of calls with enhanced testing capabilities:

| Type | Description | Use Case | Editor Features |
|------|-------------|----------|----------------|
| 📞 Inbound | Customer calling your agent | Test welcome flow, support scenarios | Use diff mode to compare different greeting versions |
| 📤 Outbound | Agent calling a customer | Test introductions, sales scripts | Focus mode helps concentrate on script testing |

<Tip>
Switch between call types to test both greetings. Use the editor's version history to compare how different versions handle each scenario.
</Tip>

## Enhanced Testing Interface

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Sending Messages

### Text Input

Type messages in the input field and press Enter or click Send. The agent will respond as it would in a real call, with enhanced debugging information available through the improved editor interface.

### Voice Input

Click the microphone icon to speak your message. The agent will:
1. Transcribe your speech
2. Process the message
3. Respond with synthesized voice

<Info>
Voice testing now integrates with the version system - changes to voice settings are immediately reflected in testing.
</Info>

## Enhanced Conversation View

The Playground displays messages chronologically with improved visualization:

| Element | Description | Editor Enhancement |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| 👤 User Message | Your inputs (text or transcribed voice) | Syntax highlighting for better readability |
| 🤖 Agent Message | Agent responses | Diff highlighting when comparing versions |
| 🔧 Tool Call | When agent triggers a webhook or action | Collapsible view with detailed parameters |
| ✅ Tool Result | Response from webhook or action | JSON formatting with syntax highlighting |

### Audio Playback with Version Tracking

For each agent response, you can:
- ▶️ Play the audio response
- ⏸️ Pause playback  
- 🔁 Replay messages
- 📊 Compare audio quality across versions

## Context Variables with Version Control

Test how your agent handles different input parameters with enhanced management:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Context Variables">
    Click the "Context Variables" panel in the Playground.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Variables">
    Set test values with version-aware validation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Version Comparison">
    Use diff mode to see how variable handling changed between versions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Testing">
    Begin testing with the configured context.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Enhanced Context Management

```json
{
  "customer_name": "John Smith",
  "order_number": "ORD-12345", 
  "is_premium_customer": true,
  "account_balance": 1250.50,
  "_version_context": {
    "version": "v1.2.3",
    "changes": ["Updated premium logic", "New balance validation"]
  }
}
```

## Reliability Test with Version Integration

Run multiple iterations with enhanced tracking:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Scenario">
    Set up your test conversation and context variables.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Version">
    Choose which version to test or compare multiple versions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Iterations">
    Choose how many times to run the test (e.g., 10, 50, 100).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run Enhanced Test">
    Click "Run Reliability Test" with version tracking enabled.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Analyze Results">
    Review consistency with version-specific insights.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Reliability tests now track version-specific performance metrics. Results may vary between versions due to model or configuration changes.
</Warning>

## Enhanced Testing Features
