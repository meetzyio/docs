## What are Output Settings?

Output Settings define what information your agent should extract and capture from each conversation. This data is then available via webhooks or API for use in your CRM, analytics, or other systems.

<Info>
Well-configured output settings turn every call into structured, actionable data.
</Info>

## AI Copilot Assistance

The AI Copilot can automatically suggest relevant output parameters based on your agent's purpose and conversation goals. It analyzes your agent's system prompt and knowledge base to recommend optimal data extraction fields.

### How AI Suggestions Work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Analyze Agent Context">
    The AI examines your agent's role, system prompt, and knowledge base to understand its purpose.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate Suggestions">
    Based on the analysis, it suggests relevant output parameters for your use case.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and Accept">
    You can review, modify, or accept the suggested parameters with one click.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
AI suggestions adapt to different agent types - sales agents get lead qualification fields, support agents get issue tracking fields, and scheduling agents get appointment-related outputs.
</Tip>

### Example AI Suggestions by Agent Type

| Agent Type | Suggested Parameters | Description |
|------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Sales Agent** | `lead_score`, `budget_range`, `decision_timeline` | Qualify leads and track sales progress |
| **Support Agent** | `issue_type`, `resolution_status`, `satisfaction_score` | Track support tickets and outcomes |
| **Booking Agent** | `appointment_date`, `service_type`, `confirmation_sent` | Manage appointment scheduling |
| **Survey Agent** | `survey_responses`, `feedback_rating`, `follow_up_needed` | Collect structured feedback |

## Output Enrichment with AI Suggestions

The AI Copilot can suggest relevant enrichment settings based on your agent's use case and the data you'll need for downstream processing.

### Smart Enrichment Recommendations

<Info>
The AI analyzes your agent's purpose to recommend which enrichment fields to enable. For example, a quality assurance agent would benefit from transcriptions and evaluations, while a lead generation agent might focus on success status and output parameters.
</Info>

### Available Enrichment Fields

| Field | Description | AI Suggests For |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| 📝 Transcription | Full conversation transcript | Quality assurance, compliance, training |
| 📋 Summary | AI-generated call summary | Management reporting, CRM integration |
| ✅ Success Status | Whether call achieved its goal | Performance tracking, optimization |
| 🆔 Call ID | Unique call identifier | System integration, debugging |
| 🤖 Agent ID | Playbook/agent identifier | Multi-agent tracking, analytics |
| ⏱️ Duration | Call length in seconds | Performance metrics, billing |
| 📅 Created | Call start timestamp | Scheduling analysis, reporting |
| 📊 Call Status | Final call status | Operational monitoring |
| ✅ Evaluations | Results of evaluation tests | Quality assurance, training |

### Using AI Enrichment Suggestions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Copilot">
    Open the AI Copilot panel while in Output Settings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get Recommendations">
    The AI will suggest relevant enrichment fields based on your agent's configuration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply Suggestions">
    Review and apply the recommended enrichment settings with one click.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Enable only the fields you need to keep webhook payloads manageable and reduce processing overhead.
</Warning>

## Webhook Configuration

Send call results to your external systems automatically.

### Setting Up Webhooks

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Webhook">
    Toggle on the webhook option in Output Settings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter URL">
    Provide the endpoint that will receive the data.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Method">
    Choose HTTP method (typically POST).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Authentication">
    Configure authentication headers if needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Webhook Configuration Options

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| URL | Your webhook endpoint |
| Method | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE |
| Auth Header | Authentication (e.g., Bearer token) |

### Example Webhook Payload

```json
{
  "call_id": "call_abc123",
  "agent_id": "agent_xyz789",
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "duration": 245,
  "status": "completed",
  "success": true,
  "output_params": {
    "customer_interest": "Premium Plan",
    "appointment_scheduled": true,
    "preferred_date": "2024-01-20",
    "satisfaction_score": 5
  },
  "transcription": "...",
  "summary": "Customer inquired about Premium Plan and scheduled an appointment for January 20th."
}
```

## Best Practices

<Warning>
Write clear descriptions for output parameters. The AI uses these descriptions to understand what to extract. The clearer your descriptions, the more accurate the data extraction will be.
</Warning>

1. **Leverage AI Suggestions** - Start with AI-generated parameters for your agent type
2. **Be Specific** - "Customer's budget range" is better than "budget"
3. **Use Appropriate Types** - Boolean for yes/no, number for quantities
4. **Keep It Relevant** - Only capture data you'll actually use
5. **Test Extraction** - Use the Playground to verify correct extraction
6. **Secure Webhooks** - Always use authentication for sensitive data
7. **Optimize Enrichment** - Enable only necessary enrichment fields
