## What is Version History?

Version History provides Git-like version control for your agent configurations with a professional interface similar to GitHub or GitLab. Every change to your agent is automatically tracked, creating a complete timeline of modifications with detailed diffs, collaborative editing support, and safe production deployment workflows.

<Info>
Version History works like a professional development environment - track changes in real-time, resolve conflicts collaboratively, commit updates with descriptive messages, and deploy to production with confidence. Never lose your work with comprehensive version tracking and conflict resolution.
</Info>

## Accessing Version History

Version History is integrated into the Advanced Editor's right panel. Click the **"Changes"** tab to access the Git-style version control interface with comprehensive change management:

- **Changes**: Review pending modifications with detailed diffs before committing
- **History**: Browse complete timeline of all versions with deployment status
- **Branches**: Manage parallel development branches for experimental features

## Production Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Frequent Commits with Clear Messages" icon="floppy-disk">
    Create version commits after each logical change rather than bundling multiple unrelated changes. Write descriptive commit messages that explain both what changed and why. This creates more granular restore points and makes the timeline easier to navigate for debugging and collaboration.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Comprehensive Testing Before Deployment" icon="beaker">
    Always test changes thoroughly using the Playground feature before deploying to production. Set up automated regression tests to catch issues early. Use staging environments that mirror production settings. Only deploy well-validated changes to minimize customer impact.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Strategic Branching for Complex Features" icon="git-branch">
    Create feature branches for major changes, experiments, or multiple-developer work. Keep the main branch stable and deploy-ready. Use branches to isolate risk and enable parallel development without conflicts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Proactive Production Monitoring" icon="eye">
    Monitor call performance metrics immediately after production deployments. Set up alerts for key performance indicators. Be prepared with rollback plans for rapid response to issues. Document deployment procedures for team consistency.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Collaborative Conflict Prevention" icon="users">
    Communicate with team members about major changes before starting work. Use the lock system effectively to prevent conflicts. Resolve conflicts promptly when they occur. Maintain awareness of who else is working on the agent.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Comprehensive Change Documentation" icon="pencil">
    Document not just what changed, but why changes were made. Include business context in commit messages. Reference tickets, issues, or requirements that drove changes. This helps with future maintenance and debugging.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting and Recovery

### Common Scenarios and Solutions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Resolving Merge Conflicts" icon="exclamation-triangle">
    When conflicts appear, the Changes tab highlights conflicting fields in red. Use the conflict resolution interface to choose between local changes, remote changes, or create a custom merge. Each conflict must be resolved individually. After resolving all conflicts, commit the resolution to complete the merge process.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Recovering Lost or Missing Changes" icon="question-mark-circle">
    All changes are preserved in version history - nothing is permanently lost. Check the History timeline for your recent commits. Use the search functionality to locate specific changes by commit message or author. If changes seem missing, they may be in a different branch or uncommitted local changes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Production Emergency Response" icon="warning">
    For critical production issues, use the emergency rollback process to immediately restore the last known good version. This stops customer impact first, then investigate the problematic version after stability is restored. Document the incident and implement preventive measures.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Synchronization Problems" icon="arrow-path">
    If auto-sync shows persistent errors, try manually using the Check and Pull buttons to force synchronization. Clear browser cache if sync issues persist. Check network connectivity and authentication status. Contact support if sync problems continue after manual refresh attempts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Collaboration Lock Issues" icon="lock-closed">
    If you're locked out due to another user's session, wait for the automatic timeout (typically 30 minutes) or contact the user directly. System administrators can manually release locks if necessary. Save your work locally to prevent loss during resolution.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Performance and Deployment Issues" icon="exclamation-circle">
    If deployed changes cause performance problems, immediately check call analytics for impact assessment. Use A/B testing capabilities if available to limit exposure. Implement gradual rollout strategies for major changes. Document performance baselines before significant changes.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
