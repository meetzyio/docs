## What is Version History?

Version History provides Git-like version control for your agent configurations with a professional interface similar to GitHub or GitLab. Every change to your agent is automatically tracked, allowing you to review modifications, commit changes with descriptive messages, and manage production deployments with confidence.

<Info>
Version History works like a professional development workflow - track changes, review diffs, commit updates, and deploy to production. Never lose your work with comprehensive version tracking.
</Info>

## Accessing Version History

Version History is integrated into the Advanced Editor's right panel. Click the **"Changes"** tab to access the Git-style version control interface with three main views:

- **Changes**: Review pending modifications before committing
- **History**: Browse complete timeline of all versions
- **Branches**: Manage parallel development branches

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Commit Early and Often" icon="floppy-disk">
    Create versions after each logical change rather than bundling many changes together. This creates more granular restore points and makes the timeline easier to navigate.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Write Descriptive Commit Messages" icon="pencil">
    Use the AI-generated suggestions as a starting point, then customize them to explain what changed and why. Future you will appreciate the context when browsing the timeline.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test Before Production Deploy" icon="beaker">
    Always test changes thoroughly in Playground before deploying to production. Use development versions for experimentation and only deploy well-validated changes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Branches for Experiments" icon="git-branch">
    Create feature branches for major changes or experiments. This keeps the main branch stable while allowing safe experimentation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor Production Deployments" icon="eye">
    After deploying to production, monitor call performance to ensure changes are working as expected. Be ready to rollback if issues are detected.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review Changes Before Committing" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Use the visual diff to review exactly what's changing before committing. Expand change details to see the full context and catch potential issues.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### Common Scenarios

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Merge Conflicts" icon="exclamation-triangle">
    When conflicts appear, use the Changes tab to see conflicting fields highlighted in red. Choose whether to keep local changes or accept remote changes for each conflict, then commit the resolution.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Lost Changes" icon="question-mark-circle">
    All changes are preserved in version history. If you can't find recent work, check the History timeline for your last commits. Use the search functionality to locate specific changes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Production Issues" icon="warning">
    If a production deployment causes problems, immediately use the emergency rollback process to restore the last known good version. Investigate the problematic version after stability is restored.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sync Problems" icon="arrow-path">
    If auto-sync shows persistent errors, try manually using the Check and Pull buttons. Contact support if sync issues continue after manual refresh attempts.
  </Accordion>
