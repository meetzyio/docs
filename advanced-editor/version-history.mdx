## What is Version History?

Version History provides Git-like version control for your agent configurations. It allows you to track changes, review previous versions, rollback to earlier configurations, and manage multiple development branches.

<Info>
Version History ensures you never lose your work and can always revert to a known-good configuration.
</Info>

## Accessing Version History

Version History is located in the right panel of the Advanced Editor. Click the "Git Changes" or "History" tab to access it.

## Key Concepts

### Versions

Each saved configuration is a version. Versions are numbered and timestamped:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Version Number | Auto-incrementing identifier (v1, v2, v3...) |
| Timestamp | When the version was created |
| Commit Message | Description of changes |
| Author | Who made the changes |

### Branches

Work on different variations of your agent simultaneously:

| Branch Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Main | Primary development branch |
| Live | Production version (what customers experience) |
| Custom | Your own feature or testing branches |

### Live Version

The "Live" version is what's deployed to production. Only the Live version is used for actual customer calls.
