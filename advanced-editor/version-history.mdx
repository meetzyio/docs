## What is Version History?

Version History provides Git-like version control for your agent configurations with a professional interface similar to GitHub or GitLab. It allows you to track changes, review previous versions, rollback to earlier configurations, and manage production deployments with confidence.

<Info>
Every change is tracked automatically, ensuring you never lose your work and can always revert to any previous state of your agent configuration.

## Accessing Version History

Version History is located in the right panel of the Advanced Editor. Click the **"Changes"** tab to access the Git-style interface.

    Write clear commit messages that explain what changed and why. This makes the history timeline much easier to navigate later.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Test Before Production" icon="flask">
    Always test changes in Playground before marking a version as Production. Use the development versions for experimentation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review Changes Before Committing" icon="eye">
    Use the visual diff to review exactly what's changing before committing. Expand change details to see the full context.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Keep Production Stable" icon="shield-check">
    Only deploy well-tested versions to production. Use the staging environment to validate changes thoroughly.
