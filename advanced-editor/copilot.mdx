## What is Copilot?

Copilot is an AI-powered prompt editor integrated into the Advanced Editor. Instead of just giving you suggestions, **Copilot directly edits and improves your agent's system prompt** based on your instructions. It analyzes your current prompt, generates improvements, and applies the changes automatically.

<Info>
Copilot doesn't just suggest - it edits. Describe what you want to improve and watch as it modifies your system prompt in real-time.
</Info>

## Accessing Copilot

Copilot is located in the right panel of the Advanced Editor. Click the "Copilot" tab or press **⌘J** to access it quickly.

## Welcome Screen

When you first open Copilot, you'll see a clean welcome interface with quick action buttons for common tasks:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Quick Actions">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Analyze & Improve">
        Click to have Copilot review your entire prompt and suggest comprehensive improvements.
        
        Analyzes structure, clarity, instructions, and effectiveness automatically.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Refine Tone">
        Makes your prompt more concise and professional.
        
        Removes redundancy and improves conversational style.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Add Output Fields">
        Automatically adds output parameters for lead qualification.
        
        Includes fields like name, email, phone, and interest level.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Create Evaluations">
        Sets up performance measurements for your agent.
        
        Creates metrics for conversation quality, goal completion, and customer satisfaction.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Voice Input">
    Use voice commands to interact with Copilot:
    
    - **Hold Microphone Button**: Press and hold the mic button in the input field
    - **Double-Shift Shortcut**: Press Shift twice quickly to start voice recording
    
    <Warning>
    Release the mic button or press Shift again to stop recording. Voice input is converted to text and processed like typed messages.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## How It Works

Copilot operates in three phases when you request a change:

| Phase | What Happens |
|-------|--------------|
| 🔍 Analyzing | Copilot reads your current system prompt and understands the context |
| ⚙️ Generating | It creates the improved version based on your request |
| ✏️ Editing | Changes are applied directly to your system prompt |

After completion, you'll see a summary of all changes made, which you can accept or reject.

## Voice Recording

Copilot supports voice input for hands-free prompt editing:

### Using Voice Commands

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Recording">
    **Hold the microphone button** in the input field, or **double-press Shift** to begin voice recording.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Speak Your Request">
    Clearly describe what you want Copilot to improve or change in your prompt.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stop Recording">
    Release the mic button or press **Shift** again to end recording.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review & Send">
    The transcribed text appears in the input field. Review and send your request.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Voice Input Tips

- Speak clearly and at a normal pace
- Use natural language - describe changes as you would to a colleague
- Voice input is transcribed to text before processing

<Info>
Voice recording works best in quiet environments. If transcription is unclear, you can edit the text before sending.
</Info>

## Call Context Integration

Reference specific calls to inform prompt improvements using the **@call:ID** syntax:

### Using Call References

```
@call:abc123 The agent failed to handle the budget question. 
Add instructions to better address pricing concerns.
```

When you reference a call, Copilot loads the transcript and uses it to understand what went wrong and how to improve the prompt.

### Call Context Indicators

Call references appear with special indicators in the chat:

- **@call:abc123** - Shows as a clickable reference with call metadata
- Hover to see call details (duration, outcome, timestamp)
- Click to open the full call transcript

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find a Problematic Call">
    Identify a call where the agent didn't perform well in your Calls dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy the Call ID">
    Use the call ID from the URL or copy from the call details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reference in Copilot">
    Type `@call:CALL_ID` followed by your improvement request.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Context-Aware Changes">
    Copilot edits the prompt based on the specific call context.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Describing Changes

In the input field, describe what you want to change. Be specific about your goals.

### Effective Requests

```
Add instructions for handling pricing objections
```

```

## Common Editing Tasks

### Adding New Behaviors

```

### Improving Specific Scenarios
```
@call:abc123 Improve how the agent handles when 
customers ask to speak with a manager
```

### Adjusting Communication Style
```
Make the entire prompt more conversational and less formal. 
The agent should sound like a helpful friend, not a robot.
```

### Adding Output Parameters
```
Add output fields to capture: customer name, email, 
phone number, preferred contact method, and interest level
```

### Creating Evaluations
```
Create evaluations to measure: conversation quality, 
goal achievement, customer satisfaction, and proper procedure following
