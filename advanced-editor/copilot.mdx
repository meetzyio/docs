## What is Copilot?

Copilot is an advanced AI-powered prompt editor integrated into the Advanced Editor. Instead of just giving you suggestions, **Copilot directly edits and improves your agent's system prompt** based on your instructions using a sophisticated structured editing system. It analyzes your current prompt, generates targeted improvements, and applies precise changes automatically through an advanced edit plan protocol.

<Info>
Copilot doesn't just suggest - it edits with precision. The new structured editing system uses targeted operations like section replacement, content insertion, and smart modifications to transform your system prompt while maintaining its structure and quality.
</Info>

## Accessing Copilot

Copilot is located in the right panel of the Advanced Editor. Click the "Copilot" tab or press **⌘J** to access it quickly.

## Structured Editing System

Copilot now operates through an advanced **EditPlan** system that provides precise, structured modifications to your agent's configuration:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Edit Operations">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Replace Section">
        **replace_section**: Completely replaces a targeted section with improved content
        
        Uses intelligent boundary detection to preserve document structure while updating specific portions.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Insert Content">
        **insert_after**: Adds new content after specified sections or markers
        
        Perfect for expanding instructions or adding new behavioral guidelines without disrupting existing content.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Append Section">
        **append_section**: Adds entirely new sections to the end of your prompt
        
        Ideal for introducing new capabilities, guardrails, or specialized instructions.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Delete Section">
        **delete_section**: Removes outdated or redundant sections cleanly
        
        Maintains document integrity while eliminating unnecessary content.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Diff Integration">
    **Built-in Diff Mode**: All changes are automatically displayed in diff view
    
    - **Green highlights**: New content being added
    - **Red highlights**: Content being removed or replaced
    - **Accept/Reject controls**: Review and approve changes before applying
    - **Section-by-section review**: Focus on specific areas of modification
    
    <Warning>

Copilot: [Makes targeted changes with diff preview]

User: Good, but make it less aggressive and more consultative

Copilot: [Refines the approach with updated diff]

User: Perfect, now add a fallback for persistent objections

Copilot: [Adds additional escalation handling]
```

<Info>
Copilot maintains conversation context across multiple requests, allowing for iterative refinement. Start a new conversation (using the menu option) when switching to completely different topics.
</Info>

## Common Editing Tasks

### Enhanced Behavioral Instructions
```
Add instructions for the agent to always confirm 
the customer's phone number before ending the call, 
and provide a backup email if the phone number is invalid
```

### Context-Driven Scenario Improvements  
```
@call:abc123 Improve how the agent handles when 
customers ask to speak with a manager - the current 
approach seemed to frustrate the customer
```

### Comprehensive Style Adjustments
```
Make the entire prompt more conversational and less formal. 
The agent should sound like a helpful friend, not a robot, 
while maintaining professionalism for business contexts.
```

### Integrated Parameter & Output Management
```
Add input parameters to capture customer budget range and timeline, 
plus output fields to track lead qualification scores and next steps
```

### Performance-Driven Evaluations
```
Create evaluations to measure: conversation quality (1-10 scale), 
goal achievement (percentage), customer satisfaction (survey-based), 
and proper procedure following (checklist compliance)
```

### Contextual Guardrail Development
```
@call:xyz789 The agent made promises about delivery dates. 
Add clear boundaries: never discuss competitor products 
or make specific delivery commitments without manager approval
```

### Call-Driven Parameter Updates
```
@call:def456 The customer mentioned their budget repeatedly 
but we didn't capture it. Add input and output parameters 
for budget tracking with proper validation rules.
```

    **Vague:** "Improve customer service handling"
    
    Specific requests generate more targeted and useful improvements.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Leverage Real Call Context">
    **Reference actual problematic calls for concrete improvements**:
    
    - Use `@call:ID` syntax to provide specific failure examples
    - Let Copilot analyze real conversation data
    - Address actual problems rather than hypothetical scenarios
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Parameter Suggestions Strategically">
    **Don't automatically accept all configuration changes**:
    
    - Check Input Parameters and Output Settings panels for purple highlights
    - Evaluate each suggestion against your specific use case
    - Consider the impact on conversation flow and data collection
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use Voice for Natural Requests">
    **Voice input excels for conversational improvement descriptions**:
    
    - "The agent needs to collect customer budget and timeline preferences"
    - "Based on call ABC-123, improve how we handle pricing questions"
    - Let natural speech guide more intuitive improvements
  </Step>
  <Step title="Follow Visual Notification Cues">
    **Purple indicators guide you to pending changes**:
    
    - Check all panels with notification dots
    - Don't miss suggestions in configuration areas
    - Use cross-panel navigation to review comprehensively
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Comprehensively After Major Changes">
    **Validate improvements before deploying**:
    
    - Use Playground to test new behaviors
    - Run regression tests to ensure quality maintenance
    - Verify parameter changes work with real data
  </Step>
  <Step title="Iterate Incrementally">
    **Make focused improvements rather than massive overhauls**:
    
    - Address one problem area at a time
    - Test changes before adding more complexity
    - Build understanding of what works through smaller steps
  </Step>
