## What is Copilot?

Copilot is an AI-powered prompt editor integrated into the Advanced Editor. Instead of just giving you suggestions, **Copilot directly edits and improves your agent's system prompt** based on your instructions. It analyzes your current prompt, generates improvements, and applies the changes automatically.

<Info>
Copilot doesn't just suggest - it edits. Describe what you want to improve and watch as it modifies your system prompt in real-time.
</Info>

## Accessing Copilot

Copilot is located in the right panel of the Advanced Editor. Click the "Copilot" tab to access it.

## How It Works

Copilot operates in three phases when you request a change:

| Phase | What Happens |
|-------|--------------|
| 🔍 Analyzing | Copilot reads your current system prompt and understands the context |
| ⚙️ Generating | It creates the improved version based on your request |
| ✏️ Editing | Changes are applied directly to your system prompt |

After completion, you'll see a summary of all changes made, which you can accept or reject.

## Quick Actions

Use pre-built actions for common improvements:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Analyze and Improve">
    Click this to have Copilot review your entire prompt and suggest comprehensive improvements.
    
    Copilot will analyze structure, clarity, instructions, and effectiveness.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Refine Tone">
    Makes your prompt more concise and professional.
    
    Removes redundancy and improves the conversational style.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Describing Changes

In the input field, describe what you want to change. Be specific about your goals.

### Effective Requests

```
Add instructions for handling pricing objections
```

```
Make the greeting more friendly and casual
```

```
Add a section about appointment confirmation procedures
```

```
Improve how the agent handles "I need to think about it" responses
```

### What Copilot Edits

Copilot can modify any part of your system prompt:

| Element | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| Instructions | Add new behaviors, modify existing rules |
| Tone | Adjust formality, friendliness, professionalism |
| Structure | Reorganize sections, add headers |
| Guardrails | Add safety limits, scope boundaries |
| Scenarios | Add handling for specific situations |
| Language | Improve clarity, remove ambiguity |

## Using Call Context

Reference specific calls to inform prompt improvements:

### The @call Syntax

Add context from real calls using `@call:CALL_ID`:

```
@call:abc123 The agent failed to handle the budget question. 
Add instructions to better address pricing concerns.
```

<Tip>
When you reference a call, Copilot loads the transcript and uses it to understand what went wrong and how to improve the prompt.
</Tip>

### Workflow with Call Context

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find a Problematic Call">
    Identify a call where the agent didn't perform well.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get the Call ID">
    Copy the call ID from the Calls dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reference and Request">
    Use `@call:ID` and describe the improvement needed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Changes">
    Copilot edits the prompt based on the call context.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example Requests with Context

```
@call:xyz789 The agent gave incorrect product information. 
Add clearer instructions about when to check the knowledge base.
```

```
@call:abc123 The customer got frustrated. 
Improve the escalation handling section.
```

## Analyzing Tickets

For bulk analysis, use the Tickets panel:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Tickets Panel">
    Click the + button and select "Analyze tickets".
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Tickets">
    Choose multiple calls/tickets to analyze.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run Analysis">
    Copilot identifies patterns across selected tickets.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply Improvements">
    Suggested prompt changes based on common issues.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Reviewing Changes

After Copilot edits your prompt:

### Change Summary

You'll see a completion summary showing:
- Title of the changes made
- Duration of the operation
- List of specific modifications

### Accept or Reject

Changes appear in the Monaco editor with highlighting:
- **Accept**: Keep the changes in your prompt
- **Reject**: Revert to the previous version

<Warning>
Always review changes before accepting. Test in the Playground to verify the improvements work as expected.
</Warning>

## Conversation History

Continue refining with follow-up requests:

```
User: Add instructions for handling price objections

Copilot: [Makes changes]

User: Good, but make it less aggressive

Copilot: [Refines the changes]

User: Perfect, now add a fallback for if they still object

Copilot: [Adds additional handling]
```

<Info>
Start a new conversation using the menu option to reset context when switching to a different topic.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be Specific About Changes" icon="bullseye">
    Instead of "make it better", describe exactly what to improve:
    
    **Good:** "Add a section for handling refund requests with a 3-step process"
    
    **Vague:** "Improve customer service handling"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Real Call Context" icon="phone">
    Reference actual failed calls when improving specific scenarios. This gives Copilot concrete examples of what went wrong.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Iterate in Small Steps" icon="stairs">
    Make incremental changes rather than trying to fix everything at once. This makes it easier to identify what works.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Test After Each Change" icon="flask">
    After accepting changes, test in the Playground before publishing to production.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review Before Accepting" icon="eye">
    Always read through the changes Copilot makes. The AI might interpret your request differently than intended.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Editing Tasks

### Adding New Behaviors
```
Add instructions for the agent to always confirm 
the customer's phone number before ending the call
```

### Improving Specific Scenarios
```
@call:abc123 Improve how the agent handles when 
customers ask to speak with a manager
```

### Adjusting Communication Style
```
Make the entire prompt more conversational and less formal. 
The agent should sound like a helpful friend, not a robot.
```

### Adding Guardrails
```
Add clear boundaries: the agent should never discuss 
competitor products or make promises about delivery dates
```

### Restructuring
```
Reorganize the prompt into clear sections: 
1) Identity, 2) Goals, 3) Guidelines, 4) Restrictions
```
