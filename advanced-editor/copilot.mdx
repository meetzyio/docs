## What is Copilot?

Copilot is an AI-powered prompt editor integrated into the Advanced Editor. Instead of just giving you suggestions, **Copilot directly edits and improves your agent's system prompt** based on your instructions. It analyzes your current prompt, generates improvements, and applies the changes automatically.

<Info>
Copilot doesn't just suggest - it edits. Describe what you want to improve and watch as it modifies your system prompt in real-time.
</Info>

## Accessing Copilot

Copilot is located in the right panel of the Advanced Editor. Click the "Copilot" tab or press **⌘J** to access it quickly.

## Welcome Screen

When you first open Copilot, you'll see a clean welcome interface with quick action buttons for common tasks:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Quick Actions">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Analyze & Improve">
        Click to have Copilot review your entire prompt and suggest comprehensive improvements.
        
        Analyzes structure, clarity, instructions, and effectiveness automatically.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Refine Tone">
        Makes your prompt more concise and professional.
        
        Removes redundancy and improves conversational style.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Add Output Fields">

    </Warning>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## How It Works

Copilot operates in three phases when you request a change:

| Phase | What Happens |
|-------|--------------|
| 🔍 Analyzing | Copilot reads your current system prompt and understands the context |
| ⚙️ Generating | It creates the improved version based on your request |
| ✏️ Editing | Changes are applied directly to your system prompt |

After completion, you'll see a summary of all changes made, which you can accept or reject.

## AI Suggestions for Input Parameters & Output Settings

Copilot now provides intelligent suggestions for input parameters, output settings, and evaluations that appear directly in their respective configuration panels. These suggestions are contextual to your current agent setup and conversation needs.

<Info>
When Copilot generates suggestions for parameters or evaluations, they appear as pending changes in the relevant panels with purple highlighting and accept/reject buttons.
</Info>

### Input Parameter Suggestions

When Copilot analyzes your agent, it can automatically suggest new input parameters based on:

- **Agent Role**: Appointment schedulers need calendar preferences, sales agents need budget information
- **Conversation Context**: Referenced calls that show missing information
- **Industry Standards**: Common parameters for your agent's domain

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate Parameter Suggestions">
    Ask Copilot to "Add input parameters for appointment scheduling" or use a quick action button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Pending Changes">
    Navigate to the Input Parameters panel to see suggested parameters with purple highlighting.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Accept or Reject">
    Each suggestion shows operation type (Add/Modify/Remove), parameter details, and accept/reject buttons.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Bulk Actions">
    Use "Accept All" to apply all suggestions or reject individual ones selectively.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Output Settings Suggestions

Copilot suggests output parameters to capture key conversation data:

```
@call:abc123 The agent collected the customer's name and interest level 
but we're missing their preferred contact method. Add output fields to capture this.
```

Copilot will analyze the call context and suggest appropriate output parameters like:
- Contact preferences (email, phone, text)
- Lead qualification scores
- Next step requirements
- Custom fields based on conversation patterns

### Evaluation Suggestions

Performance measurements are automatically suggested based on your agent's goals:

- **Conversation Quality**: Measures clarity, professionalism, and engagement
- **Goal Achievement**: Tracks completion of primary objectives
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Evaluates customer experience and satisfaction
- **Process Adherence**: Ensures agent follows required procedures

## Visual Indicators for Pending Changes

### Purple Highlight System

When Copilot generates suggestions for input parameters, output settings, or evaluations, you'll see distinctive visual indicators:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Pending Changes Banner">
    **Purple-highlighted banners** appear at the top of relevant panels showing:

## Voice Input Best Practices

### Recording Environment
- Use a quiet space with minimal background noise
- Position yourself close to your device's microphone
- Speak at a normal, conversational pace

### Effective Voice Commands
```
"Add greeting instructions for appointment scheduling calls"
```

```
"Reference call A-B-C-1-2-3. The customer was confused about pricing. 
Improve the pricing explanation section."
```

```
"Make the entire prompt sound more friendly and conversational"
```

### Voice vs. Text Input

| Use Voice When | Use Text When |
|----------------|---------------|
| Making quick improvements | Writing complex, technical instructions |
| Referencing call transcripts | Adding specific code or formatting |
| Describing tone changes | Making precise edits to existing content |
| Brainstorming improvements | Including URLs or technical specifications |

## Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Be Specific About Changes">
    Instead of "make it better", describe exactly what to improve:
    
    **Good:** "Add a section for handling refund requests with a 3-step process"
    
    **Vague:** "Improve customer service handling"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use Real Call Context">
    Reference actual failed calls when improving specific scenarios. This gives Copilot concrete examples of what went wrong.
    
    Use `@call:ID` syntax to provide context from real conversations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Parameter Suggestions">
    Check the Input Parameters and Output Settings panels after requesting parameter changes.
    
    Purple highlights indicate pending suggestions that need your approval.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Accept Changes Strategically">
    Don't blindly accept all suggestions. Review each parameter or evaluation to ensure it fits your specific use case.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Comprehensive Changes">
    When accepting multiple parameter or evaluation suggestions, test in Playground to verify everything works together.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use Voice for Natural Requests">
    Voice input works especially well for describing parameter needs: "The agent needs to collect the customer's budget range and timeline preferences."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Follow Visual Cues">
    Purple notification indicators guide you to panels with pending changes. Don't miss suggestions in other panels.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Iterate in Small Steps">
    Make incremental changes rather than trying to fix everything at once. This makes it easier to identify what works.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Editing Tasks

### Adding New Behaviors
```
Add instructions for the agent to always confirm 
the customer's phone number before ending the call
```

### Improving Specific Scenarios
```
@call:abc123 Improve how the agent handles when 
customers ask to speak with a manager
```

### Adjusting Communication Style
```
Make the entire prompt more conversational and less formal. 
The agent should sound like a helpful friend, not a robot.
```

### Adding Parameters and Output Fields
```
Add input parameters to capture customer preferences and 
output fields to track lead qualification scores
```

### Creating Comprehensive Evaluations
```
Create evaluations to measure: conversation quality, 
goal achievement, customer satisfaction, and proper procedure following
```

### Adding Guardrails
```
Add clear boundaries: the agent should never discuss 
competitor products or make promises about delivery dates
```

### Context-Based Parameter Updates
```
@call:xyz789 The customer mentioned their budget but we didn't capture it. 
Add input and output parameters for budget tracking.
```
