## What are Evaluations?

Evaluations are automated tests that assess your agent's performance after each call. They help you measure success rates, identify issues, and maintain quality standards across all conversations.

<Info>
Evaluations provide quantitative metrics to track your agent's performance over time.
</Info>

## How Evaluations Work

Each evaluation is a **yes/no question** that the AI analyzes based on the conversation transcript. After every call, Meetzy runs all configured evaluations and stores the results.

### Example Evaluations

| Evaluation | Question |
|------------|----------|
| Appointment Scheduled | Did the customer schedule an appointment? |
| Customer Satisfied | Did the customer express satisfaction with the service? |
| Issue Resolved | Was the customer's issue successfully resolved? |
| Information Collected | Did the agent collect all required information? |
| Objection Handled | Did the agent successfully address customer objections? |

### Evaluation Properties

| Property | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Name | Short identifier | "Appointment Scheduled" |
| Question | Yes/no prompt for AI | "Did the customer schedule an appointment during this call?" |

## Writing Effective Questions

<Info>
The clearer your question, the more accurate the evaluation results will be.
</Info>

### Good Questions

- ✅ "Did the customer agree to schedule a follow-up call?"
- ✅ "Did the agent verify the customer's contact information?"
- ✅ "Was the customer's primary concern addressed during the call?"
- ✅ "Did the agent mention the current promotion?"

### Poor Questions

- ❌ "Was the call good?" (too vague)
- ❌ "How satisfied was the customer?" (not yes/no)
- ❌ "Rate the agent's performance" (not answerable from transcript)

### Copilot-Enhanced Question Writing

The AI Copilot can help improve your evaluation questions:

1. **Clarity Enhancement**: Makes vague questions more specific
2. **Binary Conversion**: Converts complex questions into yes/no format
3. **Context Addition**: Adds relevant context for better evaluation accuracy
4. **Best Practice Alignment**: Ensures questions follow evaluation best practices

## Best Practices

### Start with Copilot Suggestions

<Info>
Begin by asking the AI Copilot to suggest evaluations. This provides a solid foundation based on your agent's configuration and industry best practices.
</Info>

### Evaluation Quality Guidelines

1. **Be Specific**: The more specific your question, the more reliable the evaluation
2. **Avoid Overlap**: Don't create multiple evaluations that measure the same thing
3. **Start Simple**: Begin with 3-5 core evaluations that measure your most important KPIs
4. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review evaluation results to calibrate questions
5. **Use for Training**: Low-scoring evaluations highlight areas for agent improvement

### Copilot Integration Tips

- **Iterate with AI**: Use the Copilot to refine and improve existing evaluations
- **Context Matters**: Provide context about your business when asking for suggestions
- **Test Suggestions**: Use the Playground to validate Copilot-suggested evaluations
- **Combine Sources**: Mix Copilot suggestions with templates and custom evaluations
