## What are Evaluations?

Evaluations are automated tests that assess your agent's performance after each call. They help you measure success rates, identify issues, and maintain quality standards across all conversations.

<Info>
Evaluations provide quantitative metrics to track your agent's performance over time.
</Info>

## How Evaluations Work

Each evaluation is a **yes/no question** that the AI analyzes based on the conversation transcript. After every call, Meetzy runs all configured evaluations and stores the results.

### Example Evaluations

| Evaluation | Question |
|------------|----------|
| Appointment Scheduled | Did the customer schedule an appointment? |
| Customer Satisfied | Did the customer express satisfaction with the service? |
| Issue Resolved | Was the customer's issue successfully resolved? |
| Information Collected | Did the agent collect all required information? |
| Objection Handled | Did the agent successfully address customer objections? |

### Evaluation Properties

| Property | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Name | Short identifier | "Appointment Scheduled" |
| Question | Yes/no prompt for AI | "Did the customer schedule an appointment during this call?" |

## Writing Effective Questions

<Tip>
The clearer your question, the more accurate the evaluation results will be.
</Tip>

### Good Questions

- ✅ "Did the customer agree to schedule a follow-up call?"
- ✅ "Did the agent verify the customer's contact information?"
- ✅ "Was the customer's primary concern addressed during the call?"
- ✅ "Did the agent mention the current promotion?"

### Poor Questions

- ❌ "Was the call good?" (too vague)
- ❌ "How satisfied was the customer?" (not yes/no)
- ❌ "Rate the agent's performance" (not answerable from transcript)
