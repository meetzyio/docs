## What is the Knowledge Base?

The Knowledge Base is where you provide your agent with information it can reference during conversations. This includes product documentation, FAQs, company policies, pricing information, and any other content your agent needs to answer customer questions accurately.

<Info>
A well-populated Knowledge Base significantly improves your agent's ability to provide accurate, helpful responses.

## Usage Modes

Each document in your Knowledge Base can be configured with a usage mode:

| Mode | Icon | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Auto Search | 🔍 | Agent searches this document only when relevant |
| In Prompt | 📋 | Content is always included in the agent's context |

### When to Use Each Mode

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Auto Search" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Use for large documents or reference materials. The agent will only retrieve relevant portions when needed, keeping responses efficient.
    
    **Examples:**
    - Product catalogs
    - Full documentation
    - Extensive FAQs
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="In Prompt" icon="file-import">
    Use for critical information that should always be available. This content is included in every conversation.
    
    **Examples:**
    - Company name and key details
    - Pricing tiers
    - Core policies
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
Using "In Prompt" for large documents can increase costs and slow down responses. Use it only for essential, concise information.
</Warning>
