## Key Features

### Version Control System

The Advanced Editor includes a powerful version control system with:

- **Branching**: Create separate branches for feature development
- **Change tracking**: Monitor all modifications in real-time
- **Collaboration**: See when teammates are editing and avoid conflicts
- **Rollback**: Easily revert to previous versions if needed
- **Merge capabilities**: Combine changes from different branches

<Warning>
When multiple users edit the same agent simultaneously, the system will alert you to potential conflicts and help resolve them before publishing.
</Warning>

### Real-time Collaboration

Work together seamlessly with your team:

- Live cursors show where teammates are editing
- Automatic conflict detection and resolution
- Branch-based workflow for parallel development
- Comprehensive change history and audit trail
