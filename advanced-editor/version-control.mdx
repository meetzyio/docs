The Advanced Editor features a powerful integrated version control system that enables teams to collaborate on AI agents safely and efficiently. The system tracks changes, manages conflicts, and ensures data integrity across multiple users.

## Version Control Interface

The version control interface is located in the top-right section of the Advanced Editor toolbar, displaying:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Git Status Indicator">
    Shows the current repository state with color-coded badges:
    - **Clean** (Green): No local changes, synchronized with remote
    - **Modified** (Yellow): Local changes detected
    - **Conflicts** (Red): Merge conflicts need resolution
    - **Syncing** (Blue): Currently synchronizing with remote
    - **Locked** (Orange): Another user is editing
  </Step>

  <Step title="Version Information">
    Displays current local version number in monospace format (e.g., `v42`)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Control Buttons">
    Three primary actions: **Check**, **Pull**, and **Commit**
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Git Status States

### Clean State
```
Status: Clean
Version: v42
```
- No local modifications
- Fully synchronized with remote repository
- All actions available

### Modified State
```
Status: Modified (3)
Version: v42
```
- Local changes detected (number shows modified fields)
- Can commit changes or pull updates
- May result in conflicts if remote has newer changes

<Warning>
Modified state indicates unsaved local changes. Always commit or discard changes before switching contexts.
</Warning>

### Conflict State
```
Status: Conflicts (2)
Version: v42
```
- Merge conflicts detected during pull operation
- Must resolve conflicts manually before proceeding
- Commit button disabled until conflicts resolved

### Syncing State
```
Status: Syncing...
Version: v42
```
- Currently communicating with remote repository
- All version control actions temporarily disabled
- Automatic timeout after 30 seconds for safety

### Locked State
```
Status: Locked by 2 user(s)
Version: v42
```
- Another collaborator is actively editing
- Pull operations disabled to prevent conflicts
- Check operations still available

## Version Control Actions

### Check for Updates
The **Check** button queries the remote repository for newer versions without downloading them.

```typescript
// Triggered by Check button
checkForUpdates(): void {
  // Queries remote for version comparison
  // Updates UI with available updates indicator
  // Safe operation - no local changes
}
```

<Info>
Check operations are non-destructive and can be performed at any time, even during active editing sessions.
</Info>

### Pull Changes
The **Pull** button downloads and merges remote changes with your local version.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Successful Pull">
    ```
    Before: v42 (Modified)
    After:  v45 (Clean)
    ```
    - Remote changes merged successfully
    - Local version updated to latest
    - No conflicts detected
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Conflicted Pull">
    ```
    Before: v42 (Modified)
    After:  v45 (Conflicts - 2)
    ```
    - Conflicts detected during merge
    - Manual resolution required
    - Commit disabled until resolved
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Pull Behavior:**
- Disabled when status is `syncing` or `locked`
- Automatically detects and flags conflicts
- Preserves local changes when possible
- Updates version number to remote version

### Commit Changes
The **Commit** button saves your local changes to the remote repository.

```typescript
// Example commit flow
commitChanges(): void {
  // 1. Validate all changes
  // 2. Create commit with message
  // 3. Push to remote repository
  // 4. Update local version number
}
```

**Commit Requirements:**
- Must have local modifications (Modified state)
- No unresolved conflicts
- Not locked by other users
- Valid agent configuration

## Collaboration Workflow

### Multi-User Scenarios

<Steps>
  <Step title="User A begins editing">
    - Status changes to `Modified`
    - Other users see `Locked` status
    - Prevents simultaneous editing
  </Step>

  <Step title="User A commits changes">
    - Changes pushed to remote
    - Version number increments
    - Lock released automatically
  </Step>

  <Step title="User B pulls updates">
    - Receives User A's changes
    - Local version synchronized
    - Can begin editing safely
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Conflict Resolution

When conflicts occur during pull operations:

1. **Identify Conflicted Fields**
   - System highlights specific configuration sections
   - Shows both local and remote versions
   - Provides merge assistance tools

2. **Manual Resolution Process**
   ```
   Local Version (Your Changes):
   "system_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant with sales expertise."
   
   Remote Version (Teammate's Changes):
   "system_prompt": "You are a friendly sales assistant specializing in technical products."
   
   Choose Resolution:
   [ ] Keep Local  [ ] Keep Remote  [ ] Merge Both
   ```

3. **Validation and Commit**
   - Resolved changes must pass validation
   - System ensures configuration integrity
   - Final commit includes both changesets

<Warning>
Always test your agent after resolving conflicts to ensure functionality remains intact.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

### Before Starting Work
- **Always check for updates** using the Check button
- **Pull latest changes** before making modifications
- **Verify clean state** before beginning edits

### During Development
- **Monitor status indicator** for collaboration conflicts
- **Commit frequently** to minimize merge complexity
- **Use descriptive commit messages** for team clarity

### Handling Interruptions
- **Check status** if interface becomes unresponsive
- **Wait for syncing** operations to complete
- **Refresh page** if status appears stuck

### Team Coordination
- **Communicate major changes** before committing
- **Coordinate complex modifications** to avoid conflicts
- **Test thoroughly** after merging teammate changes

## Troubleshooting

### Stuck in Syncing State
If the system remains in "Syncing" status longer than expected:

```typescript
// Automatic safety timeout triggers after 30 seconds
private runningTestsSafetyTimeout: any = null;
```

**Resolution:**
1. Wait for automatic timeout
2. Refresh the editor page
3. Check network connectivity
4. Contact support if issue persists

### Version Number Misalignment
When local and remote versions don't match:

1. **Perform Check operation** to compare versions
2. **Pull changes** to synchronize
3. **Resolve any conflicts** that arise
4. **Commit** to establish new baseline

### Lost Changes During Pull
If local changes disappear after pulling:

1. **Check browser console** for error messages
2. **Review commit history** for your changes
3. **Use conflict resolution** to recover modifications
4. **Contact support** with version numbers involved

<Info>
The system automatically backs up local changes during pull operations to prevent data loss.

## Integration with Testing

Version control integrates seamlessly with the testing system:

- **Test results** are version-specific
- **Regression testing** compares across versions  
- **Performance metrics** track version-to-version improvements
- **Rollback capabilities** allow reverting problematic changes

This ensures that your AI agent development maintains both collaboration efficiency and quality assurance throughout the development lifecycle.
