## What is Phone Health?

**Phone Health** is a monitoring system that analyzes the reputation of phone numbers assigned to your agents. It helps you identify numbers being marked as spam and take preventive action.

<Note>
  Numbers marked as spam have significantly lower answer rates. Keeping numbers "healthy" is crucial for campaign success.
</Note>

## Phone Health Indicator

In the agents list, each agent with assigned numbers shows an indicator:

### Indicator Colors

| Color | Meaning | Affected Numbers |
|-------|---------|------------------|
| 🟢 Green | Healthy | 0 numbers affected |
| 🟡 Yellow | Attention | 1-2 numbers affected |
| 🟠 Orange | Warning | 3-5 numbers affected |
| 🔴 Red | Critical | 6+ numbers affected |

The number on the badge indicates how many numbers have spam issues.

### Summary

The report shows three main metrics:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Total Numbers** | Number of numbers assigned to the agent |
| **Healthy Numbers** | Numbers without spam issues |
| **Spam Numbers** | Numbers with high spam ratio |

### Spam Threshold

```
Spam Threshold: Numbers with ≥50% spam ratio are considered problematic
```

A number is considered "spam" when more than 50% of its calls are marked or reported as spam.

### Detailed Analysis

The table shows each number with:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Phone Number** | The phone number |
| **Status** | Healthy, Warning, or Spam |
| **Total Calls** | Total calls made |
| **Spam Calls** | Calls marked as spam |
| **Completed Calls** | Successfully completed calls |
| **Spam Ratio** | Spam percentage (with visual bar) |

### Number Statuses

| Status | Spam Ratio | Description |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| 🟢 **Healthy** | Less than 50% | Number is performing well |
| 🟡 **Warning** | 50% - 70% | Take preventive action |
| 🔴 **Spam** | Above 70% | Number should be replaced |

## Available Actions

### Swap Number

For numbers with **Warning** or **Spam** status, you can swap them for a new number:

1. Click the **Swap** button next to the number
2. The system finds an available number
3. Confirm the swap
4. The old number is automatically unlinked

<Warning>
  The old number will be marked as "RETURN" and will no longer be used by this agent.
</Warning>

### Disconnect Number

To remove a number without replacing it:

1. Click the **Disconnect** button
2. Confirm the action
3. The number remains available but unassigned

Use this option when:
- You want to reduce the agent's number count
- The number has severe issues
- You'll request a new number manually

## Best Practices

### Preventing Spam

<Steps>
  <Step title="Monitor regularly">
    Check Phone Health at least once a week.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Act early">
    Swap numbers when they reach "Warning" (50%), don't wait for "Spam" (70%).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Distribute load">
    If making many calls, use multiple numbers to distribute volume.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Respect schedules">
    Avoid calling at inappropriate times that generate more spam reports.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Warning Signs

Watch for:

- Declining answer rates
- Calls ending very quickly
- Sudden increase in spam ratio
- Customers mentioning they blocked the number

## How Spam Ratio is Calculated

```
Spam Ratio = (Spam Calls / Total Calls) × 100
```

Calls are classified as "spam" based on:

- Direct user reports to carriers
- Public spam databases
- Extremely short duration (< 3 seconds)
- Systematic rejection patterns

## Top Performer Number

In the report, the best-performing number is marked with:

```
🏆 Top Performer
```

This is the recommended number to prioritize for important calls, as it has the best completion history.
