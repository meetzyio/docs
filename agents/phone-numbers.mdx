## Phone Numbers in Meetzy

Each Meetzy agent needs at least one phone number to:

- **Receive inbound calls**
- **Make outbound calls**
- **Identify itself** (caller ID)

<Note>
  Phone numbers are exclusive resources. Each number can only be assigned to one agent at a time.
</Note>

## Assign a Number When Creating an Agent

When creating a new agent in the Advanced Editor:

1. Go to the **Settings** section (Cog icon)
2. Find the **Phone Number** field
3. Select an available number from the dropdown

### If No Numbers Are Available

If the dropdown is empty, you'll see a message:

```
No available phone numbers for the selected account.
All numbers are assigned or configured.
```

**Options:**
- Release a number from another agent
- Request new numbers via the "Request more numbers" link

## View Assigned Numbers

Once assigned, the number appears in read-only mode:

```
Phone Number: +1 555 123 4567 (Sales Team) 🔒
Phone number assigned to this agent
```

<Warning>
  The phone number cannot be changed directly once assigned. To change it, use the Swap function from Phone Health.
</Warning>

## Multiple Numbers per Agent

An agent can have multiple assigned numbers. This is useful for:

- **Volume distribution**: Reduce spam risk
- **Regional segmentation**: Different numbers for different areas
- **Redundancy**: Backup if a number has issues

### How Multiple Numbers Are Used

| Call Type | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| **Inbound** | Customer can call any of the numbers |
| **Outbound** | System automatically selects the best available number |

The number with the best **Phone Health** has priority for outbound calls.

## Swap Numbers

You can swap a problematic number for a new one from the Phone Health report:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Phone Health">
    Click the health indicator on the agent.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Identify the number">
    Find the number with Warning or Spam status.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Swap">
    Click the **Swap** button next to the number.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    The system shows the proposed new number. Confirm the swap.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### What Happens During a Swap

1. **Old number** is unlinked and marked as "RETURN"
2. **New number** is assigned and immediately active

## Disconnect a Number

To remove a number without replacing it:

1. Open the **Phone Health** report
2. Click **Disconnect** next to the number
3. Confirm the disconnection

<Warning>
  If you disconnect the agent's only number, it won't be able to make or receive calls until you assign another.
</Warning>

## Request New Numbers

To request additional numbers:

1. In the Advanced Editor, Settings section
2. Click **"Request more numbers"**
3. You'll be redirected to the request portal

New numbers are typically available within 24-48 hours.

## Supported Country Prefixes

Meetzy supports phone numbers in multiple countries:

| Country | Prefix | Availability |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| United States | +1 | Available |
| Spain | +34 | Available |
| Mexico | +52 | Available |
| Argentina | +54 | Available |
| Colombia | +57 | Available |
| United Kingdom | +44 | Available |

<Tip>
  Use local numbers from your customers' country to increase answer rates. Customers are more likely to answer calls from local numbers.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

### Number Rotation

For high-volume campaigns:

1. Assign multiple numbers to the agent
2. The system rotates automatically
3. Monitor Phone Health regularly
4. Swap numbers before they reach "Spam" status

### Number Identification

Each number has a **Friendly Name** for identification:

```
+1 555 123 4567 (Sales Team)
       │              │
       │              └── Friendly Name
       └── Number
```

Use descriptive names like:
- "Sales Team"
- "Support Line"
- "Campaign Q1"
